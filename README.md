Kubegres PostgreSQL Deployment

This manifest file defines a set of Kubernetes resources for deploying a PostgreSQL database using the Kubegres operator, with persistent storage provided by a GlusterFS-based storage class. The code also includes a secret for storing sensitive information such as passwords and access keys, and an IngressRouteTCP object for exposing the database service over the mypostgres entry point.
Prerequisites

Before deploying the resources, you should ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

    A Kubernetes cluster with Kubegres and Traefik installed
    A GlusterFS-based storage class configured in the cluster

Usage

To deploy the resources, run the following command:

kubectl apply -f kubegres-postgres.yaml

Replace kubegres-postgres.yaml with the name of the manifest file.
Customization

The manifest file includes hard-coded configurations for each resource, which may not be suitable for all environments. To customize the deployment, you can modify the manifest file to change the configuration of each resource.
Error handling

The manifest file does not include any error checking or handling. If a command fails, the script will continue to execute without providing any indication that an error occurred. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially compromise the stability of the system. It's important to include error handling and logging to ensure that any issues are detected and addressed promptly.
